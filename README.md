# Multi-shelled-ECIF

### Script
* msecif.py
   * 

### Examples
1. Ex1_generate_feature.ipynb
   * Feature generation example of multi-shelled ECIF and weighted ECIF. This notebook generates Ex1_multi-shelledECIF_feature.csv and Ex1_weightedECIF_feature.csv.
3. Ex2_train_model.ipynb
   * Model training example of multi-shelled ECIF and weighted ECIF.

### Results
* multi-shelledECIF_all_results.csv
   * Evaluation results of multi-shelled ECIF of all conditions (threshold and step) and all seed values. The evaluation was performed with pearson correlation coefficient ï¼ˆPCC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) of the CASF2016 core set.
* weightedECIF_all_results.csv
   * Evaluation results of weighted ECIF of all conditions (threshold) and all seed values. The evaluation was performed with PCC and RMSE of the CASF2016 core set.
* FeatureImportance/feature_importance_thresh10.0_step1.0.csv
   * All the feature importance of the best multi-shelled ECIF model.
